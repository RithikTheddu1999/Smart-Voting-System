In this project a new authentication technique in voting system using facial recognition of
the voter is used. In India, currently there are two types of voting system in practice. They are secret
Ballet paper and Electronic Voting Machines (EVM), but both of the processes have some
limitations or demerits. The current voting system is not safe and secure too. So, parties in power
try to make use of this situation and poll votes in favor to them which may leads to many problems.
That’s why in this project we have proposed a system or way which is very effective or useful in
voting. In our approach we have three level security in voting process.
 First level is the verification of election id number (EID).
 Second level is OTP verification
 Third level is face recognition or face matching.
The security level of our system is greatly improved by the new application method for each
voter. The user authentication process of the system is improved by adding face recognition in
application which will identify whether the particular user is authenticated or not. To implement
this idea, we will build a python app which has its backend up and running with Voters pictures, it
takes Voter ID as input and matches with the live picture using Local Binary Patterns(LBP)
Machine Learning Algorithm, if it matches then the voter can poll his vote
